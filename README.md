Constructing a QA Bot That Leverages the LangChain and LLM to Answer Questions from Loaded Documents


In this project, I have combined  skills to construct a question-answering (QA) bot. This bot will leverage LangChain and a large language model (LLM) to answer questions based on content from loaded PDF documents. I bring together various components, including document loaders, text splitters, embedding models, vector databases, retrievers, and Gradio as the front-end interface, to build a fully functional QA system.

It is an intelligent assistant that can quickly and accurately respond to queries based on a extensive library of PDF documents. This could be anything from legal documents to technical manuals. Manually searching through these documents would be time-consuming and inefficient. That is why this Bot will Help you.
